        <p> Arriving in this alternate world with someone claiming to be a goddess!

 

Part 1

The carriage drove over the pavement and made loud creaking sound.

“… Another world… Hey, it really is another world. Eh, it’s for real? I am going to used magic and adventure in this world?”

I was trembling with excitement because of the scene before me and started talking to myself.

Before my eyes were houses built from red bricks, the streets right out of Europe in the Middle Ages.

There were no cars, bikes, power lines or telecommunication cables.

 

“Ah… Ah… Ahh…”

I looked around the street, watching the people passing by.

“Animal ears! There is someone with animal ears! And elf ears! Is that an elf? With such striking facial features, she definitely is one! Good bye hikikomori life! Hello different world! If it was this world, I am willing to go out and work obediently!”

“Ahh… Ahhh…. Ahhhh!”

I turned around and looked at Aqua who was hugging her head screaming.

“Hey, you are noisy. What if they think I am related to a crazy woman like you? Stop screaming, you should be giving something to me at a time like this right? Look at what I am wearing. Gym clothes? I finally arrived in a fantasy world but I am wearing a full set of gym clothes. According to the norm in games, you should be giving me the minimum equipment…”

“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh–!”

The goddess screamed as she pounced over to grab me.

“Woah! What, what are you doing, don’t act this way! I get it, I will do something about the basic equipment. I should say that I was wrong! If you are unwilling, please go back . I will think about what to do in the future.”

Aqua tried to strangle me with teary eyes, so I shook off her hand and tried to shoo her away with an annoyed expression.

In the end, Aqua said with trembling hands:

“What are you talking about? I am troubled because I can’t go back! What now? Nah, what should I do! What am I going to do in the future?”

Aqua fell into a panic in tears, pacing about while hugging her head.

Her waist length hair was a mess, she looked crazy right now, although she’s was a beauty when she kept quiet.

“Hey, calm down goddess. The first place to visit should be the bar. Everything starts from collecting information at a bar. This is the standard in role playing games.”

“Huh…! You are just a hikikomori gaming NEET, why are you so reliable? Ah, Kazuma, my name is Aqua. I don’t mind you addressing me as goddess, but do call me by my name whenever possible. Or else we would be surrounded by citizens and couldn’t go on adventures and take down the demon king. This might be a different world, but I am still one of the revered gods of this world.”

Aqua said as she followed behind me confidently.

Alright, there should a group formed to take on the demon king or an adventurer guild made to defeat monsters.

Speaking of which, Aqua is a goddess, he can ask her if he had any questions.

“Aqua, please tell me where is the position of the adventurers guild. Which way should we go?”

I asked Aqua, but she just looked at me blankly.

“…? I won’t know even if you ask me. I know the common knowledge of this world, but not the situation in town. This is just one of the many existing planets, and just a small town at that! How would I know?”

This fellow is useless.

There’s no other way, so I asked a middle aged lady passing by.

I didn’t asked guys for fear of meeting delinquents, while the difficulty of talking to young girls were too high for me.

“Excuse me– may I ask something? I am looking for a place similar to an adventurers guild…”

“Guild! Ara, to not know where the guild is, could you be from out of town?”

From what the madam was saying, there really was a guild here, which made me relieved.

“That’s right, I am a traveler who came from a far away land, I just reached this town.”

“Ara ara… Since you came to this town, you must be aiming to become an adventurer. Welcome to the town of novice adventurer, Axel. Follow the main road and turn right, you will see the signboard for the guild.”

“Take a right down the road, got it, thank you very much! … Hey, let’s go.”

A town for novice adventurers

I see. This was a good starting point for the dead who gets transported here.

After thanking the lady, I followed her directions while Aqua followed me with respect in her eyes and sighed:

“Nah, you came up with an excuse right on the spot, why are you able to handle this so perfectly? You seemed to be a capable guy, why were you a hikiNEET without any girls or friends? Why did you want to stay at home all day and be a hikiNEET?”

“Not having a girl or friends isn’t a bad thing. The value of a person cannot be measured by the number of friends or having a significant other. And don’t call me a hikiNEET. Damn bitch. Don’t combine hikikomori and NEET together, and I am just 16, too young to be a NEET by society’s standard… There it is.”

Aqua pounced over to strangle me for calling her a bitch, but I ignored her and entered the adventurers guild.

— Adventurers guild–

A place for adventurers to take up jobs, which was a staple in games, an organization that supported the adventurers.

The job agency of this world.

There was a rather large establishment before them and the fragrance of food drifted from within.

Some rough characters would definitely be inside.

They might find trouble with me if they saw unfamiliar faces.

After preparing myself mentally and entering…

“Ah, welcome~ Please approach the counter if you looking for jobs. If you are here to dine, please take any empty seat~!”

A waitress with short red hair received us warmly.

The slightly dim interior seemed to double as a bar.

Groups of men in armor could be seen congregating inside, but they didn’t seem to bear ill will.

But unfamiliar faces seemed to be rare, everyone was focusing on us.

… I realized why they were looking this way.

“Nah nah, they are looking this way too blatantly. It must be the holy aura coming from me, they must have discovered that I am a goddess.”

The reason was the appearance of the goddess speaking dumb words.

She looked like a beauty if she stayed quiet, and was attracting everyone’s eyes.

For now, I ignored their gaze and went about my original objective.

“… Listen carefully Aqua, they will gave us a tutorial if we register, enabling us to earn a living. That’s the kind of place adventurers guilds are. We should be able to take a loan to prepare ourselves, complete simple jobs to get by and introduce us to a good tavern. Most games start out this way. Normally, preparing the bare essentials to live in this world should be your job… But never mind. For today, let’s register with the guild, get some equipment and money, and find a place to sleep.”

“I don’t care about that. My job was sending the dead to this world. But I get it. I am not familiar with games, but what you said was common sense for this world. So I just need to register to be an adventurer too, right?”

“That’s right. Alright then, let’s go.”

Taking Aqua with me, I made a beeline for the counter.

There are 4 counter staff.

2 of them were female.

I queue up at the counter with the prettier lady.

“… Nah, the other 3 counters are empty, why are you queuing here? We won’t have to wait if we go to another counter… Ah, because this counter staff is the prettiest? Really, I was just a bit impressed and thought that you were reliable, but you are doing this?”

Aqua who was following me didn’t know anything, so I whispered to her quietly:

“Building a good rapport with the guild’s counter staff is the basics. And the pretty counter lady definitely had plenty of flags to raise. This means there will be more shocking hidden side quest waiting for us. For example, the counter lady might be a powerful adventurer or something.”

“… Now that you mentioned it, I saw something similar in a manga. Sorry, I will wait in line obediently.”

Because we did not approach the other empty counter and intentionally queue here, the other staff was looking at us curiously. But I decided to pretend not to notice.

It was finally our turn.

“Good morning, how may I help you?”

The counter staff was a gentle beauty.

Her wavy hair and large breast made her look matured.

“Eh, I want to be an adventurer. I came from the countryside and didn’t know anything…”

If I tell the counter staff I came from the countryside or a far away nation, they will give a more thorough explanation.

“I see. There will be a registration fee, will that be okay?”

That’s right, this is the basic tutorial.

I will just need to follow the instruction of the counter staff…

… Registration fee?

“… Hey Aqua, you have any cash on you?”

“I was transported here all of a sudden, how is it possible for me to have money?”

… How could this be, shouldn’t they loan some money to us or put it on the tab for now?

I moved away from the counter and discuss the strategy with Aqua.

“… Hey, what now? We are in a pinch right from the beginning. In games, you would normally get the minimal equipment and some money for living expenses too.”

“All of a sudden, you became unreliable. But it can’t be help, you are a hikkikomori after all. Alright, it’s time for me to shine. Just watch, I will show you the capability of a goddess.”

A man wearing the loose and cumbersome clothing of a priest was seated at a table.

Aqua approached that man confidently…

“Man of the cloth, please state thy religion! I am Aqua. That’s right, Goddess Aqua, worshipped by the Axis theocracy! If thou art a believer…! …Could you give me some aid by lending me some money?”

With an attitude that seemed aloft yet humble, she asked him for money.

“… I am from the Eris sect.”

“Ah, I see, sorry…”

I don’t get it, but they seemed to be from different religious orders.

When the dejected Aqua was preparing to come back, the priest stopped her.

“Ah… Madam, you must be a follower of Axis. There were stories about Goddess Aqua and Goddess Eris being close, so this might be fate. I had been observing you, you have trouble paying the registration fee correct? It’s just a small fee, so please take it as a blessing from Goddess Eris. But no matter how devout you are, you shouldn’t use the title of the Goddess in vain.”

“Ah… Okay, sorry… Thank you very much…”

The eyes of Aqua looked dead as she returned with the money.

“Hahaha… He didn’t believed that I am a goddess… By the way, goddess Eris is my junior… I was pitied by the believer of my junior goddess, and received his money…”

“What matters is that you completed the task. Think about it, if he really believed that you are a goddess, there would be a different kind of trouble!”

Aqua had an expression that seemed to say she lost something important, so I encouraged her half heartedly.

“Eh… We are back with the registration fees.”

“I… I see… The registration fees are 1000 Eris…”

Aqua received 3000 Eris from the priest.

According to Aqua, 1 Eris is about 1 yen, so she received about 3000 yen.

The counter lady didn’t interfere the commotion we stirred up, and was unwilling to look at me and Aqua in the eye.

It seems I had broken the flag between this lady and me.

“Alright. Since you said you want to be an adventurer, you should have some level of understanding, but I will explain it from the start… First, adventurers are responsible for the extermination of the monsters wandering outside the town… People who get rid of dangerous creatures that might harm the citizens. They are also jack of all trades, taking on odd jobs that requires their talents… People who earn a living this way are known collectively as adventurers. And among adventurers, there are different jobs.”

Finally, its coming.

This is a norm for adventurers. Be it jobs, class or whatever they are called, you have to choose the way you fight in this world.

Compared to the blunt warrior profession, flashy jobs like mage would be better.

The counter lady handed me and Aqua one card each.

It was about the size of a driving license, and seemed to be a kind of identification card.

“Please look over here, do you see the word level? As both of you know, all things in the world have souls. No matter what form it takes, if you eat or kill a being, you can absorb a part of the memory of the soul. This is known as ‘Experience Points’.

‘Experience Points’ are normally intangible things, but…”

The counter lady pointed to one part of the card and continued:

“With this card, the ‘Experience Points’ the adventurer had absorbed would be shown here. At the same time, the level corresponding to your ‘Experience Points’ would also be displayed. This show how strong an adventurer is, and how many enemy you defeat would be recorded here. With the accumulation of ‘Experience Points’, all creatures would grow stronger rapidly at some point. This is known as leveling up… Simply put, leveling up will grant you all sorts of perks, such as skill points to learn new skills. So please work hard to increase your level.”

After listening to the explanation, I recalled something Aqua said.

She asked me ‘Do you… like games?’

I got it. After listening to all that, this world was just like a game.

“First of all, please fill in your height, weight, age and other details in the blanks.”

I filled in my particulars in the form given to me by the counter lady.

Height is 165cm, weight 55kg. 16 years old, brown hair and eyes…

“That will be fine. Please touch this card. This will display the strength of each of your abilities as reference to chooses your job. After accumulating skill points, you can learn skills that are available to your jobs. This is one of the key points in choosing jobs.”

Oh, it was time for this.

The time to show my amazing potential and create a big commotion in the guild.

With tense emotion and a heart of expectation, I touched the card.

“… Alright, thank you. Satou Kazuma san right. Let’s see… Strength, vitality, magic, agility and speed… All of them are average, intelligence is a slightly better than average… Huh? Luck is very high. But it is not very relevant for adventurers… This is troubling, from the numbers, you can only choose the most basic ‘adventurer’ job! Since your luck is so high, I suggest you give up being an adventurer and be a merchant… What would you like to do?”

Hey, my life of adventuring was being denied right from the very start, what is this.

The corners of Aqua’s lips were high in a smile, tempting me to punch her.

Me being weak doesn’t help your cause.

“Erm, I would like to be an adventurer…”

The counter lady said with a face of worry:

“It, it’s fine, after leveling up and your stats improve, you can change your job! And the adventurer job is similar to its definition, it is a combination of all jobs… That’s right, it might be a basic level job, but it doesn’t mean it is worse than others! Adventurers could learn and use the skills of all jobs after all!”

“On the other hand, you need more skill points to learn skills. Without the bonus attribute of the actual job, your skills would be weaker when compared to them. It’s a jack of all trade, master of none.”

After the counter lady point out the good points, Aqua immediately shot me down.

I should find a place to throw her away.

It seems that I would be taking a basic job, or a beginner job.

Anyway, it was the weakest job.

But I am still an adventurer that appeared in this world.

As I received my card with my name and the job ‘adventurer’ written on it with a heavy heart…

“Eh? Huh~! What is with these numbers? Besides the lower than average intelligence, and luck which is pit bottom, the rest of your stats drastically exceeds the average! Especially your magic, it is abnormally high, who in the world are </p>
